# This is a GitLab CI configuration to build the project as a docker image
# The file is generic enough to be dropped in a project containing a working Dockerfile

# Mentioned here: https://blog.callr.tech/building-docker-images-with-gitlab-ci-best-practices/

# do not use "latest" here, if you want this to work in the future
image: docker:20

stages:
  - build
  - push

variables:
  # fill those if you have a proxy in your environment
  http_proxy: ""
  https_proxy: ""
  no_proxy: ""

# Use this if your GitLab runner does not use socket binding
# services:
#   - docker:dind

before_script:
  # docker login asks for the password to be passed through stdin for security
  # we use $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD here which is a special variable provided by GitLab
  # https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html
  - echo -n $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD | docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER --password-stdin $CI_REGISTRY
